### Adjacent

Adjacent is a tiny program that displays a translation of an English word in other languages of a single linguistic group.
Choose from the Slavic, Germanic or Romance groups.

> adjacent -group=s -word=sky

The above will display how "sky" is written in a few Slavic languages, such as Croatian, Polish, Serbian and so on.

If no group or word is supplied, the program will use the default values.
The linguistic group is then Slavic, and the word is "language".

The goal is to explore and showcase the similarity of roots in languages that are considered closely related.

Some Wikipedia pages have tables for a word in multiple related languages. This program allows one to query for any word 
and get a similar overview.
